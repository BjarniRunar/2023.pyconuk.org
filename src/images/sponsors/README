Sponsor logos go here.

Try to keep the size down to about 20K if possible, by resizing and using tools like optipng.
Also, try to keep the image resolution close to that used in the sponsors page.

Width should be scaled relative to height to keep the aspect ratio.
Heights should be:
Headliner: 180
Gold: 160
Silver: 150
Bronze: 140
Other: 130

Examples:
Resize with imagemagick for a silver sponsor (height 150):
convert -resize 300X150  source.png dest.jpg

But how do I know what dimensions to use?
First you need to know the current dimensions. On systems where the 'file' command is available: pretalx.png: PNG image data, 550 x 302, 8-bit colormap, non-interlaced
Otherwise, you should be able to find these using a graphics manipulation tool (e.g. paint.net).
Now, we want this logo to go in (in this case) the 'other' section, which means it needs to have a height of 130. We can see that the current height is 302.
Therefore, the scaling factor is 130/302 ~ 0.43.
We multiply the current height by this factor to get ~ 237.
Now, we can convert it using:
convert -resize 237x130 pretalx.png pretalx.png
We'll also set these values for the width and height in the sponsors.md (and associate the appropriate URL to link to that sponsor).
Try to make sure that every image is < 20KB.
